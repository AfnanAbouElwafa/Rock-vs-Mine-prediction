# Rock-vs-Mine-prediction
Used two machine learning models, which are Logistic Regression and Kernelized Support Vector Machines, to predict if the object is a rock or a mine. Using a sonar data.


##  **Data**

All values are between 0 and 1 so it is suitable for Kernelized Support Vector Machines algorithm.

##  **Model Evaluation**

Training accuracy using Logistic Regression: 0.834225

Testing accuracy using Logistic Regression: 0.761905

Training accuracy using SVMs: 1.000000

Testing accuracy using SVMs: 0.904762



Source: Siddharthan channel but I added SVMs algorithm.
